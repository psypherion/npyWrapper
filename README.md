# npyWrapper

npyWrapper is a high-performance Python-based wrapper for `.npy` files, designed to overcome limitations in scalability, concurrency, and querying, making `.npy` files a viable alternative to vector databases in production. This wrapper supports advanced features like efficient data partitioning, metadata indexing, cloud integration, and redundancy, providing a resilient, cloud-ready solution for storing and querying high-dimensional data.

## Features

1. **Enhanced Scalability**
   - **Dynamic Data Partitioning**: Allows `.npy` datasets to be partitioned for efficient handling of large-scale data, preventing the need to reload entire files with each update.
   - **Optimized Storage Structure**: Efficiently organizes data across multiple `.npy` files to handle large datasets with minimal latency.

2. **Concurrency and Multi-User Access**
   - **Concurrency Support**: Designed to support multiple users reading or writing concurrently.
   - **Access Control**: Customizable access levels provide fine-grained control over read and write permissions for multi-user environments.

3. **Advanced Querying and Search**
   - **Metadata Indexing**: Attaches searchable metadata to `.npy` files, enabling users to filter data based on attributes without loading entire files.
   - **Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN)**: Integrated ANN search algorithms allow for efficient similarity searches directly on `.npy` data.
   - **Flexible Query API**: User-friendly query API supporting chained queries and filtering.

4. **Cloud Integration and Backup**
   - **Seamless Cloud Storage Support**: Works with major cloud providers like AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage, enabling scalable, distributed storage.
   - **Automatic Backup and Replication**: Built-in options for periodic backups and replication, ensuring data durability and easy restoration.

5. **Reliability and Fault Tolerance**
   - **Redundant Storage Mechanisms**: Ensures data remains accessible, even in case of partial failures, with redundancy options.
   - **Automatic Recovery**: Fault-tolerant protocols recover lost or corrupted data segments from backups.
